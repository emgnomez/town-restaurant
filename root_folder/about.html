    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      <b>TOWN</b> was established in 1988, serving the lower Manhattan community for over 30 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chef Chan Yan-Tak, a famous chef who was accomplished in his practice working at top restaurants in Shanghai, came
      to New York City to open a restaurant focused on bringing authentic Chinese cuisine to the people.
      It was a resounding success upon opening and people from all around the world have come to experience the meal of
      a lifetime here.
